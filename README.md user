# User Information Collector

This program prompts the user for their name, age, and location, and then prints that information to the screen.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Create a new Python file (e.g., `user_info.py`).
3. Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```python
# user_info.py

def main():
    # Ask for user input
    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age = input("Please enter your age: ")
    location = input("Please enter your location: ")

    # Print the collected information
    print(f"\nHello, {name}!")
    print(f"You are {age} years old.")
    print(f"You are located in {location}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

4. Save the file.
5. Open your terminal or command prompt.
6. Navigate to the directory where your file is saved.
7. Run the program using the command:

   ```
   python user_info.py
   ```

## Output

After running the program, you will see prompts asking for your name, age, and location. Once you provide the information, it will display it back to you.

## Example

```
Please enter your name: John
Please enter your age: 30
Please enter your location: New York

Hello, John!
You are 30 years old.
